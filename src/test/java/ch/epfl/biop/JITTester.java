/**
 * Simple tests of potential arithmetic simplification that I think
 * a JIT compiler should be able to do:
 * - Multiplications by ones
 * - Additions with zeros...
 *
 * My wish is that special cases matrices computations could be auto-simplified.
 * (a translation matrix is only 3 additions in 3D)
 * Apparently we're not there yet, or simply I don't know how to trigger the magic
 *
 * I tried OpenJDK 1.8, OpenJDK 18, Graalvm-ce-17, none of them were able to
 * discard what appears to be no-ops
 *
 * Due to the simplicity of the code, please re-use and modify as you wish
